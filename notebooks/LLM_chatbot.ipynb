    "- secondly focus on the extraction of the parameters for the matched operation\n",

    "\n",
    "The output of the two prompting methods seems to be comparable in the example above, with one case (change_rent) where the two-step prompting missing the house unit. Only a limited examples are tested, so would be too early to draw strong conclusion as to which methods is functionally better.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does look like that the one-step prompting is at least as capable as the two-step appraoch, and is definitely more efficient in terms of the number of LLM calls. Looks like a better approach to take further for further development of both the prompt conent, and the response management of the chatbot. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Future Work\n",
    "Due to limited time scope, and the experimental nature of this exercise, there are plenty of scope to expand the work in several aspects, these are listed in the following \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2.1 further work on data structure design\n",
    "<b> property data structure </b> It should be desirable to include in the prompting templates some a general representation of the data structure for the properties under management, typically this could come with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- property_id - for unique identification of property in underlying database \n",
    "- properyt_name\n",
    "- area\n",
    "- erv\n",
    "- rent\n",
    "- status - rented/listed/recently_sold/recently_rented/unlisted\n",
    "- value - for_rent/for_sale/rented/sold_value \n",
    "- operation_target_date - target date of the last valid operation \n",
    "- operation_date - date of the last valid operation \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> operation data structure </b> The operation data structure can be further refined to be consistent with API call or other functional calls signature, this would provide a more explicit link between the chatbot and the underlying property management system.  This also can facilitate multi-steps operations to be performed single user chat session, with additional feedback provided to the user as of the execution status of the previous operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2.2 improvement of conversational control \n",
    "Ideally this chatbot should be implented in conjunction with conversational AI framework, such as [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) for more professional integration, or with easier to integration chat-oriented application such as telegram for experimental purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the above technical exercise, the conversational control can be much improved by having a better connection with the LLM's response, and offer options accordingly based on such response. For instance, if certain required parametes are given null value by the LLM, options should be provided for the user to fill in the missing information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2.3 implementation of non-proprietary LLM \n",
    "With proprietary LLM API such as OpenAI, one can build state-of-the-art chatbot with little overhead in the form of model fine-tuning, and can expect increasingly better performance at least in the short-mid term as computation scaling law still upholds. This however come with the drawback of high API cost espeically in the situation where the chatbot application is to be used by large number of users. Additionally, we don't have directly control in terms of down time and quality degradation. Also, the fine-tuning option of such APIs are sometime limited to selected version of models and often come with additional tech constraints \n",
    "\n",
    "With open source LLM such as Llama 3.1, especially with the [smaller version](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B), we have the option to tail the chatbot's behaviour to proprietary property information either by doing RAG operation on text that are more focus on property information. Additionally, with additional user/chatbot conversation data, we can perform efficient fine-tuning with algorithm such as \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2.4 evaluation and improvement of conversation quality \n",
    "For any LLM app, including chatbot, it is critial to have a well-established workflow to set up benchmark on conversational quality and perform continuous evaluation on chatbot/model iteration. This is important for both the purpose of continuous improvement, but also to filling the gap on the chatbot's awareness of any niece topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following concreate actions would shall be considered before the project move beyond early versions:\n",
    "- Setup process to curate chat dataset tailored to the property management information - from existing documentation, human expert knowledge, and synthetically generated data \n",
    "\n",
    "- Work on evaluation metrics that reflect the chatbot's ability in aiding conversation on property management topics - potentially a balanced consideration between chatbot's ability at facilitating accurate action, and the general chat quality at understanding diverse input format and quality with proper response \n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate labelled chatdata set according the above evaluation metrics, perhaps with a blend of human labelling, LLM labelling, and depend on the context other automatically marking mechanism \n",
    "\n",
    "- Setup experiment control and tracking mechanism, perhaps to start with setting up simple tracking with package such as [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- systematic improvement of prompt quality - build up repository of quality prompts, and also use automatic package such as [TextGrad](https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad)\n",
    "\n",
    "- explore the explanatbility on chatbo's response - this is an area still under developed, but one can investigate the application of existing package that NLP suitable, such as [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime), as well as devising explanation mechanisum via basic principles - such as statistical response between core vocabulary, language style, and the chatbot's response quality \n",
